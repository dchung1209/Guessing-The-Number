# Guessing-The-Number
HS project

The game “Guessing the number” is literally about guessing the number. The game is suitable for two mature friends to strengthen their relationship without being aimed at two kids. Also, the game “Guessing the number” would be a great source to develop early learning skills for younger children. While guessing the number, children can improve their level of detection ability, intelligence, cognitive, memory, and even critical thinking with given hints. It seems to be a simple game, but it includes a high level of competition between two players and critical thinking.
